# Twitter-Social-Networking-Analysis
The goal of this project is to gather, analyze, and visualize none-profit organizations' relationships through the Twitter API.

How to use this project (Assumeing you have an Excel file with the organizations information): 

1) Clone the project into an empty folder in your desktop (or somewhere).
2) In the TwitterRelationships file, edit lines 15-21 by adding your Twitter secert keys.
3) In the TwitterRelationships file, edit line 25 by changing the path of the Excel file (Dataset containting your name) to where you saved the file. If you have a mac, make sure you are writing the path in the right way:
              Mac OS X: /Users/username/Desktop.
              Windows: C:/Users/username/Desktop.
              Linux: /home/username/Desktop.
5) If you have two projects and two Excel files, make sure each project is linked to a different file
6) Run your project 
7) After 1 minute of running the project you should see a message saying "Getting the relationship of..."

If the program was paused for some reason, just rerun it again as the data would be saved. Please make sure that you do not open the file while the program is running. It might delete everything. 

Let me know if you have any questions.
